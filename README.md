## About this repository

This GitHub repository contains the software, test results and test files developed and acquired in the 5th semester Electrical Engineering project 'Control system for automated delivery drones'. The purpose of this project is to make a [Crazyflie 2.1](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) fly a predefined path autonomously by first acquiring and utilizing a set of transfer functions describing the response of the pitch, roll, yaw and thrust commands supplied by the Crazyflie Realtime Protocol.
